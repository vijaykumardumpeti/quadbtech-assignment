# Internship Test - ReactJS Developer Profile Set-1

Welcome to the Internship Test for ReactJS Developer Profile Set-1! In this assignment, you will create a web application that helps users find job postings related to specific programming languages and apply for those jobs. This README provides instructions and guidelines for completing the assignment.

## Guidelines

Please adhere to the following guidelines while completing the assignment:

1. **Assignment Duration**: You have 1 day to complete the assignment. We expect the assignment to be submitted in full within this timeframe.

2. **Readme Attachment**: Ensure that you attach a README file to your code with relevant information about your project.

3. **React Router**: Use React Router for implementing routing in your application.

4. **Redux**: Utilize Redux for state management within your application.

5. **UI and Functionality**:

   - Implement a login/signup feature with minimal but relevant login details.
   - Use `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` to manage sessions for logged-in users.
   - Create a landing page with a single input field where users can specify the programming language they are looking for job opportunities in.
   - Once the user selects a language, make a request to the GitHub public API to search for job listings that require developers with expertise in that language.
   - Display a list of job listings to the user, along with an option to view each job in detail.
   - Upon selecting a job posting, make another API request to fetch the specific job details.
   - Create a separate page to display the job details, including an option to apply.
   - When the user chooses to apply, prompt them to provide the following information:
     - Name
     - Email
     - Cover Letter Note
     - Optional: Include a file upload feature for resumes, cover letters, or other relevant documents.
   - After the user submits the application form, show them a success page. The success page should provide a preview of the submitted application data.
   - Note: The success page does not require making additional API requests; you should use state management to display the success page.

6. **Design and Validations**: You have the creative freedom to design the pages, implement necessary validations, and define any specific rules for the application. However, please ensure that the application follows best practices in terms of user experience and design.

## Getting Started

To start working on the assignment, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local development environment.

2. Create a new React project in the cloned repository using `create-react-app` or your preferred method.

3. Implement the features and functionality outlined in the guidelines above.

4. Test your application thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.

5. Attach a README file to your codebase with details about how to run your application and any additional information you would like to provide.

6. Submit your assignment by the specified deadline.

## Important Notes

- While the assignment provides a set of guidelines, you have flexibility in designing and implementing the application as long as the core requirements are met.

- Ensure that your code is well-organized, follows best practices, and includes appropriate comments where necessary.

- Remember to handle error cases gracefully, provide feedback to users, and validate user inputs.

Good luck with your assignment, and we look forward to reviewing your work! If you have any questions or need clarification on any aspect of the assignment, please feel free to reach out for assistance.
